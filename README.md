Challenges

Step 1: Data Gathering & Ingestion

Ingest your data into storage of a cloud platform of your choice. Do not modify the data during the process. While you do not need to make this repeatable, be prepared to discuss how you might automate this process if additional files were to be provided, and how you might ensure security of the data.

Step 2: Prepare & Cleanse the data in memory

Prepare the data by combining the 10 trans fact files and replacing any null sales and null units with zero. Be prepared to discuss any additional considerations that you would need to take into account if you were asked to extend this process to a second (unrelated) retail store.

Step 3: Gather insights from data

The data provided allows us to gather many different insights into the performance of the ACME business and performance of the loyalty program. Use the cleansed data above to provide the following insights.

· The president of company wants to understand which provinces and stores are performing well and how much are the top stores in each province performing compared with the average store of the province.

· The president further wants to know how customers in the loyalty program are performing compared to non-loyalty customers and what category of products is contributing to most of ACME’s sales

· Determine the top 5 stores by province and top 10 product categories by department
